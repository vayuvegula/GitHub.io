***Overall company strategy and goals should inform AI strategic implementation***

The ideal reader of the article has a business degree and is someone who is experiencing “Fear of Missing out” on the AI revolution and is raring to hit the “Go” button.Be cautious, good old problem framing/solving skills are still required for an effective AI strategy. Actually, for any strategy.Enjoy the read and please leave a comment with your thoughts on how AI strategy is being implemented at your company.
I personally believe that one has to start with understanding the problem before trying to articulate a solution.Sounds obvious, but more often than not one tends to jump into problem solving even before taking the time to frame the problem and goals.
In the article I present the way I would think about analyzing an industry,an individual company within the industry, a problem to be solved within the company and finally how to assess the effectiveness of implementing AI solutions to solve those particular problems. Ofcourse, depending upon your expertise and domain knowledge you would spend time a different time at each stage.

Porter’s forces for an industry’s structural analysis:Often we could lose sight of the forest for the trees.Day to day activities could make us lose sight of industry dynamics, competitive position of the company and the various external pressures on the company.For example if the company has staked out a position as a low cost provider,then most likely the customers are low budget customers.An AI strategy to increase the revenue per user might not yield the expected results.Instead it might be better to look for efficiencies in the manufacturing process or supply chain.

**A brief explanation of the Porter’s forces :**

**New Entrants:** New entrants will often bring additional capacity to the industry and consequently a risk of price competition.If your industry has low barriers to entry and is at risk of new entrants, perhaps the AI strategy has to be geared towards increasing the stickiness of the customers.

**Internal competition:** Most companies will stake out a position in the market either through pricing of the product or through product differentiation.Being aware of the strategy adopted by your company will again help inform the appropriate strategy.

**Substitutes:** There will be a downward pressure or at the minimum a ceiling on the prices that can be charged for a particular product that can be easily substituted.The appropriate AI strategy in this case could be in reducing the cost of production thus keeping allowing the company to have a competitive advantage compared to a similar product.

**Suppliers and Buyers:** Powerful suppliers and buyers will tend to squeeze the profits from the company’s bottom line.
Once you have a decent understanding of the industry and your company’s position in it,you can advance to understand the internal working of your company by mapping it’s activities onto the business model canvas.

**Mapping company activities to the business model canvas:** The idea behind mapping the activities of the company onto a business model canvas is two fold.

Primarily identify which part of the company does it make sense to start applying AI methodologies.Once you identified a particular area , one should be able to highlight the Economic value add activities.
It is much easier to have an economic value add as a target than to keep fine tuning models for better and better accuracy with diminishing returns.
And now finally before jumping headlong into trying to implement AI projects first make an assessment of where you stand on the criteria stated below.

**The basics criteria required to kickstart any AI project:**

- **Executive sponsorship:** As per a McKinsey&Co. study in 2017 only 30% of the companies were digitally transformed.Meaning they had processes and data that were easily accessible digitally.If your company is yet to go through a digital transformation, it is important to have executive sponsorship as the transformation is a cross organizational effort.

- **AI talent:** You will need experienced talent who are well versed with the nitty gritty of machine learning.It is very easy to learn the basics,but true expertise is more of an art than a science and can only come through experience.This is especially true for deep learning techniques.Depending on the scale of the project you will require a good mix of data scientists,data engineers,machine learning computing engineers,product managers and AI strategists.

- **Data and digital infrastructure:** It is often said Data is the new oil and with good reason.The outcome of the AI algorithms are only as good as the data you feed them.Good quality data (labelled) and in great quantities is essential.However the data collection can be more thoughtful and efficient once an AI strategy is in place.The AI strategy will help inform the kind of data to be collected and the quantity.Likewise a digital infrastructure for data storage, processing of algorithms and rendering the models is required.Depending on the companies data privacy needs a choice has to be made between on premise versus cloud infrastructure.

Assuming you have the Executive sponsorship for the project and the necessary talent, we can start framing the approach.

Remember at all stages, the industry position staked by your company,the internal activities adopted by your company and th e AI strategy implemented all have to march in sync towards the same goal.

**Assess the Economic value add:**

Assessing the economic value add basically means translating into a dollar impact any improvements gained in the activities identified due to AI transformation.This is typically a separate business casing exercise and in the domain of business analysts.

In this example it is obvious that the AI strategist will start with activities in Priority I category as it has high economic value add and also the availability of data is very high.Now we can go ahead and try a variety of machine learning techniques that can help with meeting the economic value add goals.

It is general practice to start with the simplest machine learning algorithms before going down a more complicated path of sophisticated models like deep learning.It is entirely possible that your goals could be met with the simplest models or at the very least implementing simple models to start with is a quick and dirty way of gaining an end to end understanding of the pipeline to be implemented and the various challenges you are likely to come across.

The same methodology is repeated for various activities identified in the business model canvas and prioritized based on their economic value add and the larger strategic goals of the company as identified by Porter’s forces analysis.

This way of framing the AI strategy provides a very actionable roadmap to the business teams as well as the technical teams to pursue as they will have a very clear understanding of the goal they are trying to achieve with measurable and meaningful metrics.
